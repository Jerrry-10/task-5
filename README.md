# Task-5


I have created a simple React app that allows you to increment and decrement a counter using useState it’s code is at https://github.com/matgargano/task-5 use this code as a starting point.

Remove the useState usage and refactor it to handle all of the components state through a useReducer hook

The state should include:

    the current count value
    the “Number to Increment/Decrement by”

The useReducer hook should be used to update the state whenever the buttons are clicked along with the updating of the “Number to Increment/Decrement by” value.

This assignment is a straightforward way to demonstrate that you understand the useReducer hook and give you a chance to practice using it to manage state in a React application.
